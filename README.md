This is the code for the GovHack entry for myself and Morgyn Bostock for 2024. The random forest model code includes the code for a random forest predicting both early childhood vulnuerability by LGA in 2026 and 2031 and the demand for health and social service workers in 2026 and 2031. We used these results to identify the LGAs with the need for the largest growth in the health and social service workforce, which could inform Victorian Government planning. The LGAs with the highest projected increase in need for health and social service workers are: Melton, Bayside, Hume, Melbourne, Maribyrnong and Greater Dandenong.

The LGAs with the highest number of predicted children with early development vulnerabilities are: Wyndham, Casey, Melton, Whittlesea, Hume and Melbourne.
