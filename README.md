This is the code for the GovHack entry for Morgyn Bostock and myself for 2024. The random forest model file includes the code for a random forest predicting both early childhood vulnuerability by LGA in 2026 and 2031 and the demand for health and social service workers in 2026 and 2031. We used these results to identify the LGAs with the need for the largest growth in the health and social service workforce, which could inform Victorian Government planning. The mapping file includes code that heatmaps Victorian LGAs by their relative need for additional health and social service workers by 2031.

The LGAs with the highest projected increase in need for health and social service workers are: Melton, Bayside, Hume, Melbourne, Maribyrnong and Greater Dandenong.

The LGAs with the highest number of predicted children with early development vulnerabilities are: Wyndham, Casey, Melton, Whittlesea, Hume and Melbourne.
